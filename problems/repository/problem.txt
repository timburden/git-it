  Create a new Git repository.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  A {bold}repository{/bold} is essentially a project. You can imagine it
  as project's folder with all the related files inside of it. In
  fact, that's what it will look like on your computer anyways.

  You tell Git what your project is and Git will start tracking all
  of the changes to that folder. Files added or subtracted or even
  a single letter in a single file added -- all of it's tracked and
  time stamped by Git.

  Create a Repository{/bold}
  -------------------{/cyan}
  
  You're going to create a new folder and initialize it as a Git
  repository. You'll need some basic terminal (Bash) commands (see 
  below) for moving around and creating folders (just like you'd do 
  in Finder or Windows Explorer). 
  
  To make things easier, name your folder what you'd name the project,
  keep it lowercase, no spaces or symbols. How about 'sandwich'.
  
  You can type all of this here in your terminal window.
  
  To make a new folder:
  
  $ mkdir sandwich
  
  To go into that folder:
  
  $ cd sandwich
  
  To create a new Git instance for a project:

  $ git init

  That's it! It will just return you to a new line.
  
  When you've initialized a new Git repository, run:
  
  $ git-it verify

  $ mkdir <FOLDERNAME>

  {bold}Navigate into an existing folder (aka change directory){/bold}

  {bold}List the items in a folder{/bold}

  $ ls 
  
  {bold}Turn Git on for a folder{/bold}
