  Configure Git and GitHub.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  The repository you've created so far is just on your computer, which
  is handy, but makes it pretty hard to share and work with others on. 
  No worries, that's what GitHub.com is for! In this challenge, 
  get Git and GitHub configured.

  Configure Git{/bold}
  -------------{/cyan}

  You'll want to let Git know who to associate the changes you make to 
  by telling it your name, GitHub account name and email address.

  Type these into terminal to configure Git:

  $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  
  Then add your GitHub username:
  
  $ git config --global user.username githubusername

  Now set your email:

  $ git config --global user.email youremail@example.com
  
  When you've set everything up, run `git-it verify`
