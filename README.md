# Git-it

![ss](https://raw2.github.com/jlord/git-it/master/git-it-ss.png) 

A [workshopper](https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper) module for learning Git and GitHub - Social coding, y'all. These modules run a little app in your terminal and users work their way through the challenges. See [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io) for more.

**For developer documentation, see [dev-doc.md](#).**

## Hello, future Forkers, Branchers and Pull Requesters! 

This app runs in your Terminal (Mac) or Bash (Windows) and has challenges for learning Git and GitHub. It uses the _real_ terminal (so you'll be learning the awesome command line), it uses _real_ Git and GitHub which means when you finish all of the challenges you'll have _real_ repositories on your GitHub account and green squares on your [contribution chart](https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions).

#### What you'll need to run this:

_A few development essentials, all are free and/or free and open source._

- **Git**, this is your tracker of changes! You can download it [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads). (Note: on Windows, in the setup wizard, choose "Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt")
- **Node.js**, this is what this app is written in so you'll need this to run it. It's an engine for running JavaScript on servers (your computer is a server!) and will live quietly in the background. You can download it [here](http://nodejs.org/download/).
- **Editor**, if you don't have one already, you'll need a text editor for editing code. A few options: [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), [Textmate](http://macromates.com/download), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

#### Install Git-it

Once you have the essentials above, install Git-it. 

- Open up a terminal window and install Git-it globally on your computer (so that you can run it from anywhere). [NPM](http://www.npmjs.org) delievers Node.js modules (that's what this app is) to your computer from the command line, real easy like (it is included when you install Node.js):

```bash
$ npm install -g git-it
```
- Once it's done installing components, you can run it:
- _If you run into trouble with this command it may be due to permissions on your computer, try adding 'sudo':_ `sudo npm install -g git-it`

```bash
$ git-it
```
- This should load the menu. You're ready to go! 

#### How it Works

- Use the arrows to select the first challenge and press 'Enter'. 
- Read the challenge text, do as it says and when you're done type `git-it verify` to see if you've compelted the challenge correctly.
- If the challenge components were not completed correctly, Git-it returns some text to help you know what went wrong.
- For some challenges you'll need to open new terminal windows and then run Git-it inside the window you've just opened. Git-it can run from any  (or mutiple) terminal windows and always saves your completed status. You'll need to run it from where you're doing your Git work, so it's OK to move around like that.
- Scroll up! When the challenge loads, it scrolls to the bottom. Scroll up to the top of the challenge to not miss steps.

**If you have any questions about something, just create a [new issue](https://github.com/jlord/git-it/issues/new).**

#### Tips

**Code snippets** often times look like `$ some code-stuff --here`. The dollar sign identifies the line as one a user would enter into the the command line, but you don't actually include it when you type it into terminal. In this case, you'd actually just type `some code-stuff --here`.

**Variables** are indicated by `<VARIABLENAME>` in code snippets. When you actually use the line of code, replace it, including the <>, with your variable. For instance to make a new folder in terminal the format is, `mkdir <FOLDERNAME>`, so if you wanted to make a folder named 'octocat', you'd type: `mkdir octocat`.

**Command line, terminal, bash** all basically mean the same thing: the MS-DOS, Doogie Howser looking screen full of words and numbers. It's awesomely powerful. You can do a lot of things from your terminal like delete, rename, copy or create files and folders; run scripts and send things back and forth between servers (like the ones storing things on GitHub.com) and your computer (also a server!).
